# Continue in VS Code with Codex

Recommended: VS Code with the official OpenAI Codex extension, working on a local clone of `git@github.com:ScottJMiller/monstrum-mortis.git`. VS Code is the editor; Codex is the agent that can inspect and change the opened project. There is no need to migrate the game to an OpenAI runtime, add an OpenAI API, or create an API key for the game.

## Import this step 1 handoff

The chat workspace could not clone over SSH, but it successfully cloned this empty repository over HTTPS. The foundation was committed locally on `implementation/step-1`. Pushing failed because this workspace has no GitHub write credentials, so the branch is not on GitHub. Use the provided ZIP to import the work into your local clone, then push using your own GitHub authentication. Treat your actual GitHub clone as authoritative for any subsequent changes.

1. Install Node 24 LTS, Git, VS Code, and the official Codex extension; open Codex and sign in through its supported account flow.
2. Clone your repository locally:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:ScottJMiller/monstrum-mortis.git
cd monstrum-mortis
```

If SSH access is not configured on your machine, use your normal GitHub SSH setup or clone over HTTPS. This package does not include credentials.

3. If `implementation/step-1` is available on GitHub, check it out and skip manual import:

```sh
git fetch origin
git switch --track origin/implementation/step-1
```

If pushing was unavailable and a handoff ZIP was provided instead, extract it elsewhere. It contains a `monstrum-mortis/` folder with the project files, excluding `.git`, dependencies, generated build output, and login files.
4. Compare any existing files in your clone before copying the handoff contents into it. Preserve its `.git` directory. If the remote has an existing README, license, workflow, or `AGENTS.md`, merge deliberately rather than overwrite it blindly. The assistant could not inspect those remote files.
5. For a manual ZIP import only, create a branch. If you already checked out the remote foundation branch, just run the npm commands:

```sh
git switch -c implementation/step-1
npm ci
npm run check
npm run build
```

6. Open the folder in VS Code. Review the changes with Git, then commit and push using your own configured identity:

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Establish Monstrum Mortis project foundation"
git push -u origin implementation/step-1
```

No deployment is triggered by this push; CI/CD is not configured yet.

## First prompt for the local Codex session

> We are developing Monstrum Mortis. Read AGENTS.md, docs/APPROVED-PLAN.md, docs/IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md, and docs/CLOUDFLARE-SETUP.md. The user approved the plan and requested step 1 only. Review the foundation, run the documented checks, and guide me through local Wrangler login and account verification. Keep scottjmiller.com and www on their existing self-hosted setup; initial deployment must use workers.dev only. Do not begin step 2 until I ask. Do not assume this new session has the earlier chat history.

The approved specification and project documents provide continuity independently of the chat. Return to this interface whenever you want to review design choices or discuss a larger change.
